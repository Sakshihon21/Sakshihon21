Hi there, I'm Sakshi Hon(@sakshihon21) Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Passionate about technology and innovation, I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in "Information Technology" at Sanjivani College of Engineering, Kopargaon.
My technical journey began with a Diploma in Computer Technology from Sanjivani KBP Polytechnic, where I built a strong foundation in programming, software development, and IT infrastructure.
